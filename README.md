# 3D-Unet
A single-file implementation of 3D unet on a 3D Prostate Segmentation Task

A reimplementation of: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06650.pdf which is based off of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf

The dataset was acquired from here: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/NCI-ISBI+2013+Challenge+-+Automated+Segmentation+of+Prostate+Structures

Results aren't too great but were trained for only 10000 iterations using an old laptop. If you get the chance to rerun the code, do let me know if you're able to get any better results/if anything is wrong!
